# Call MATLAB from Python to Compare PyTorch Models for Image Classification
# Overview


This example shows how to call MATLAB and Simulink from Python to start using pre-trained PyTorch® image classification models. 

In Python, load and preprocess the image, import pretrined PyTorch models and run an initial classification. 

For example, take advantage of MATLAB's easy-to-use low-code apps for visualizing, analyzing, and modifying deep neural networks, or deploy the imported network.

This example also shows the co-execution workflow between PyTorch and Deep Learning Toolbox. You can use the same workflow for co-execution with TensorFlow™.
